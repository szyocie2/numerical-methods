# Numerical Methods

This repository contains implementations of various fundamental numerical methods used to solve mathematical and engineering problems.  
Inside you'll find code and explanations for techniques such as Gaussian elimination (with partial pivoting), Euler’s method, Heun’s method, Runge-Kutta 4, Lagrange and Newton interpolation, numerical integration (including 2D Gaussian quadrature), LU and Cholesky decompositions, and more.

Designed as a practical toolkit and learning resource, this collection covers around a dozen core numerical algorithms, all written clearly and ready for study or extension.
